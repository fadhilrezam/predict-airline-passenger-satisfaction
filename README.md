# predict-airline-passenger-satisfaction
In this project, I make a Machine Learning Model to predict an airline passenger satisfaction. are they satisfied or not, based on the services that they get on and off the board. From this project the best model that I got is by using Gradient Boosting Classifier with 95 % Accuracy.

Section:
1. For the main project you can check on my notebook 'https://github.com/fadhilrezam/predict-airline-passenger-satisfaction/blob/main/model_prediction_notebook.ipynb', where how understand the data and how I made the model.
2. train.csv is the dataset where I train the model
3. test.csv is the dataset where I test the model that I've been made
4. For backend and frontend is still in progress, but you can check my Web App for this project (for the EDA things of this dataset), link: https://front-end-streamlit-fadhil.herokuapp.com/

That's all a short brief about my project on predicting passenger satisfaction. Happy Reading All !
